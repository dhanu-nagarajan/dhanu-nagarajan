🎮 **AI Engineer TaxTech & Compliance Platforms | M.Sc in Computer Games Technology | 300M+ Game Visits 🚀**

# Hi, I'm Zaex! 👋

I'm a technically equipped creative visionary I’m an AI Engineer at AskSolique, building next-generation TaxTech and Compliance automation systems powered by LLMs, embeddings, vector search, and end-to-end intelligent workflows. With a Master’s in Computer Games Technology from the University of London and 300M+ visits across the games I’ve built, I blend creative product engineering with deep technical capability to deliver scalable, auditable, real-world AI solutions. I’ve taken projects from concept to execution, focusing on both the technical and creative aspects of development. I combine creative product leadership with deep technical skills in ML, LLMs, embeddings, vector search, and secure production integrations to ship pragmatic TaxTech and Compliance solutions.

## 🌟 **What I Do @ Solique:**
- **AI-Fueled Compliance & Tax Automation:** Architect and implement intelligent workflows that turn complex regulatory texts into structured, actionable decisions.
- **Hybrid Retrieval Systems:** Build BM25 + vector search pipelines, RAG systems, and LLM-driven summarization layers optimized for auditability.
- **Document-to-Decision Engines:** Develop ingestion-to-recommendation pipelines that convert filings, notices, and rulings into clear compliance outputs with provenance metadata.
- **Risk Scoring & Monitoring:** Design rule + ML hybrid scoring systems to detect anomalies, reduce false positives, and provide explainable outputs.
- **Secure, Production-Grade Services:** Deliver scalable and safe LLM integrations with strict controls, logging, and traceability for compliance environments.

## 🔥 **Skills & Expertise:**

- **TaxTech & Compliance Engineering**
  - Regulatory extraction and structuring of dense tax law into machine-usable formats
  - Automated residency logic, treaty classification, and regulatory lookup flows
  - RAG pipelines with citation preservation, source mapping, and audit trails
  - Workflow orchestration for compliance teams (search → classify → recommend → record)

- **AI & ML Systems**
  - LLM orchestration, embeddings, vector search, hybrid retrieval
  - Python automation pipelines, ETL, streaming ingestion, bulk indexing
  - Confidence scoring, reranking, and safety-controlled prompting
  - Postgres, Elasticsearch/Qdrant, metrics, observability & governance

- **Game & Systems Development**
  - End-to-end real-time systems architecture and gameplay engineering
  - Leading multi-disciplinary teams through concept, prototype, release & live ops
  - Designing player-driven mechanics and ML-enhanced engagement systems

- **Leadership & Product Delivery**
  - Cross-functional coordination
  - Clear technical direction
  - Rapid prototyping → hardened production rollout
  - Community engagement and feedback-driven iteration
