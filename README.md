🎮 **Founding AI Engineer TaxTech & Compliance Platforms | M.Sc in Computer Games Technology | 300M+ Game Visits 🚀**

# Hi, I'm Zaex! 👋

I'm a technically equipped creative visionary who's an AI Engineer &  game developer that works with cutting edge Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. Fostered under University of London with a Master’s in Computer Games Technology from City St George's University of London, specializing in building and leading talented development workflows to create immersive, large-scale experiences. With over 300 million visits across my games, I’ve taken projects from concept to execution, focusing on both the technical and creative aspects of game development. I combine creative product leadership with deep technical skills in ML, LLMs, embeddings, vector search, and secure production integrations to ship pragmatic TaxTech and Compliance solutions.

## 🌟 **What I Do:**
- **AI Fuelled Automation Workflows**: I handcraft personalized AI end to end workflows that fit every kind of business need that arises. 
- **Game Development Lead**: I've directed the entire game development lifecycle—from concept and prototyping to final release and live service updates.
- **Team Leadership**: I manage cross-functional teams, ensuring seamless collaboration between designers, developers, and artists to bring our visions to life.
- **Creative Direction**: My passion lies in designing unique game mechanics, creating engaging worlds, and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in with AI to create immersive experiences on and off the screen.

## 🔥 **Skills:**
- **AI + TaxTech Products:** Design and deliver AI agents and pipelines that automate tax research, document classification, regulatory extraction, and risk scoring.
- **Game & Systems Development:** Lead end-to-end game engineering and large-scale real-time architectures while applying ML-driven features to improve player engagement.
- **Compliance Automation:** Create workflows for regulatory monitoring, document summarization, and audit trail generation to reduce manual review and improve controlability.
- **Team Leadership:** Build and scale cross-functional teams to move rapidly from prototype to production.
- **Game Design**: End-to-end game development, level design, and player experience optimization.
- **Project Management**: Agile workflows, task prioritization, and managing full development cycles.
- **Community Building**: Fostering active communities on Discord and YouTube, engaging players, and gathering feedback to improve gameplay.


## **TaxTech & Compliance**

- **Regulatory Extraction:** Convert dense statutes, notifications, and rulings into structured knowledge using hybrid retrieval (BM25 + vector) and LLM summarization for fast, auditable lookups.
- **Document-to-Decision Pipelines:** Architect systems that ingest filings, map obligations, and surface compliance actions with confidence scores and provenance metadata.
- **Automated Residency & Tax Advice Tools:** Prototype decision-assist flows (questions → hybrid search → LLM-rerank → explanation) that help determine tax residency and treaty implications while preserving source citations.
- **Auditability & Controls:** Emphasize traceable outputs — store source IDs, timestamps, and prompts; preserve original text; and produce machine-readable trails for review.
- **Risk Scoring & Alerts:** Combine rule-based checks with ML signals to prioritize potential compliance issues and reduce false positives.


## **AI & Technical Skills:**

- **Models & Patterns:** LLMs (OpenAI/compatible), SentenceTransformers (embeddings), vector search (Elasticsearch/Qdrant), RAG and hybrid retrieval, prompt engineering, model gating for safety/cost control.
- **Engineering:** Python pipelines, streaming ETL, batch encoding, bulk index tuning, TLS/auth for secure services, Postgres + analytics.
- **Production Practices:** Env-driven configs, dry-run safety, incremental syncs, metrics/logging, settings restore, and small-batch safety for live clusters.
- **DevOps & Governance:** CI-friendly scripts, audit logging, reproducible runs, and risk-mitigation patterns for model outputs.


## **Impact & Outcomes (how I measure success)**

- Faster expert triage (prototype reductions in time-to-answer).
- Traceable recommendations (source-linked summaries for auditors).
- Scalable ingestion (streaming ETL + tuned bulk indexing for large corpora).
